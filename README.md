# ML_experiments
Learning ML from Harvard's course on Coursera and sharing the code. Each written algorithm is based on a particular problem but can be easily applied to other problems of the same level of complexity. For example: 

- **Linear regression** was aimed at predicting a) house prices given historical data on different houses in the area; b) revenue of a food company given their current locations and their historical populations and revenues
- **Logistic regression** was aimed at predicting a) 2-factor QA test results for microchips coming from the assembly line; b) student admission to a university given a student's ongoing marks
- **Artificial Neural Network** was aimed at recognizing a) a hand-written number from 0 to 9 - **still in progress**
