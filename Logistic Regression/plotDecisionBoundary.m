function plotDecisionBoundary(theta, X, y)
%PLOTDECISIONBOUNDARY Plots the data points X and y into a new figure with
%the decision boundary defined by theta
%   PLOTDECISIONBOUNDARY(theta, X,y) plots the data points with + for the 
%   positive examples and o for the negative examples. X is assumed to be 
%   a either 
%   1) Mx3 matrix, where the first column is an all-ones column for the 
%      intercept.
%   2) MxN, N>3 matrix, where the first column is all-ones

% Plot Data
plotData(X(:,2:3), y); %passing exam scores and admission results to plotData which simply outputs positive and negative admissions as + and o respectively
hold on

if size(X, 2) <= 3
    % Only need 2 points to define a line, so choose two endpoints
    plot_x = [min(X(:,2))-2,  max(X(:,2))+2]; %-2 and +2 just to provide some exmpty space when looking at the graph in the full screen %plot_x calculates two x1

    % Calculate the decision boundary line
    plot_y = (-1./theta(3)).*(theta(2).*plot_x + theta(1)); %plot_y calculates two x2 respective to x1; x2 = -(theta1+x1*theta2)/theta3 since 0=theta1+theta2*x1+theta3*x2

    % Here is the grid range

    z = zeros(length(u), length(v));
    % Evaluate z = theta*x over the grid
    for i = 1:length(u)
        for j = 1:length(v)
            z(i,j) = mapFeature(u(i), v(j))*theta; % each iteration mapFeature returns smth like 1x27 and then 1x27 is multiplied by theta which is 27x1 -> resulting number z. When we get 2500 z's, we plot the decision boundary which is oval-ish in our case. In other words, we plot the non-linear decision boundary by com- puting the classifierâ€™s predictions on an evenly spaced grid and then and drew a contour plot of where the predictions change from y = 0 to y = 1.
